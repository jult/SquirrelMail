# SquirrelMail

A stack of (GUI and security) patches I use for a group of Debian webmail servers.

Note that the original source is written en updated mostly by Paul Lesniewski, not by me, but since Debian sadly stopped shipping SM in their repositories, I created my own here, for convenience's sake.

If you want to contribute to this here master (making SM more github sourced), feel free to use/comment/fork.

I'm keeping this sync with validated/self-tested Stable Snapshots from https://squirrelmail.org/download.php and security-related patchwork (see https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/squirrelmail ).
