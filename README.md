# SquirrelMail

Package holding a stack of (GUI, security and php) patches I use for a group of Debian webmail servers.

Note that the original source is written and updated mostly by Paul Lesniewski, not by me, but since Debian sadly stopped shipping SM in their repositories, I created my own here, for convenience's sake.

Keeping this sync with validated/self-tested Stable Snapshots from https://squirrelmail.org/download.php and security-related patchwork (see https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/squirrelmail ).

Thanks to Hanno BÃ¶ck and Andrew Sachen for a few patches for php 7.*

If you want to contribute to this here master (making SM more github sourced), feel free to use/comment/fork.

Original source documentation resides under /doc
