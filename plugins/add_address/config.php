// When testing if several addresses are in an address book,
// as of SquirrelMail 1.4.16, this plugin asks the address
// book to look up each address one at a time.  If using
// certain address book backends with large numbers of
// address lookups, this may create unnecessary load on the
// backend.  When this threshold is met (number of addresses
// being looked up at a time), the entire address book contents
// are instead pulled from the backend and cached long enough
// to search for each address in memory instead.
//
// Finding the right threshold is likely to be both system-
// specific and dependent upon the address backend type being
// used and overall system load, as well as the average size
// of user address books.  Please send feedback on what numbers
// worked for you along with details about your system.
