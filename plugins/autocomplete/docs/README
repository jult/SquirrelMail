Description
===========

This plugin searches user contacts as the user types into the
To/Cc/Bcc fields on the compose screen, displaying those that
match for quick selection.  Various forms of matching and
other behaviors are configurable by the administrator and/or
each user.

If you or your company make regular use of this software,
please consider supporting Open Source development by

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.0

  * Compatibility plugin version 2.0.7 or above



License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see COPYING for details).



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If the plugin does not seem to be working at all, make
    sure JavaScript is enabled in the browser and verify that
    the user has not disabled the "Use Javascript" setting
    under Options->Display Preferences.

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be showing
    in the user interface, ensure that you are editing the correct
    configuration file.  If one is located in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory (named "config_autocomplete.php"), it will
    always be used.  Otherwise, "config.php" in the autocomplete
    plugin directory will be used.

    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug
    output, the plugin configuration settings you've made and
    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.
