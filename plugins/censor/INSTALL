Installing Censor
=================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the censor plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -xzvf censor-1.0-1.4.2.tar.gz

2) If you want to change the default behavior of the plugin,
   change into the censor directory, copy config.sample.php 
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as 
   you deem necessary.

  $ cd censor
  $ cp config.sample.php config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Also, if not using SquirrelMail 1.4.10+ or 1.5.2+, please 
   verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin installed 
   (but not necessarily activated).

5) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

       http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php



Upgrading Censor
================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the censor plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -xzvf censor-1.0-1.4.2.tar.gz


2) Change into the censor directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.  (This
   step only applies if you have created a config.php file 
   under step 2 above when you first installed the plugin.)

  $ diff -u config.php config.sample.php

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
