Censor plugin for SquirrelMail
==============================
Ver 1.0, 2007/08/01

Original authors: Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>


Description
===========

This plugin allows you to create a list of words that are 
considered unacceptable in outgoing emails.  Emails containing 
such words can be blocked, or can have such words removed 
before sending.

This plugin should be used with care, and it is made available 
with the hope that there are some better uses for it other than
for prudish, over-zealous administrators who are bent on violating 
their users' privacy and freedom of speach.  The sample word lists
herein probably do just that, so please consider providing your
own, more reasonable lists.

Help requests are welcome at my personal email address, but I
request that you first post to the SquirrelMail Plugins mailing
