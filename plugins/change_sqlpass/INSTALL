Installing the Change SQL Password Plugin
=========================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.3 version of the change_sqlpass 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar zxvf change_sqlpass-3.3-1.2.tar.gz

2) Change into the change_sqlpass directory, copy config.php.sample 
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as you deem 
   necessary.

  $ cd change_sqlpass
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins" 
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.



Upgrading the Change SQL Password Plugin
========================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 3.3 version of the change_sqlpass 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar zxvf change_sqlpass-3.3-1.2.tar.gz

2) Change into the change_sqlpass directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
