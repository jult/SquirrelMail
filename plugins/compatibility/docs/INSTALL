Installing the Compatibility Plugin
===================================

1) Untar the file into the plugins directory.  Here is an example 
   for the 1.0 version of the compatibility plugin.

      $ cd plugins
      $ tar -zxvf compatibility-1.0.tar.gz

2) If you use SquirrelMail version 1.5.1 or greater or SquirrelMail
   version 1.4.13 or greater, skip to step 4.

3) Patch your SquirrelMail source code - a new plugin hook
   is necessary for this plugin, and it can easily be added
   to most SquirrelMail versions.  Make sure you use the
   patch file that pertains to your version of SquirrelMail.
   The patch command can be run from the compatibility plugin 
   directory:

      $ patch -p0 < patches/compatibility_patch-1.4.4.diff

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

   If you need a patch for an older version of SquirrelMail, first
   ask yourself why you cannot upgrade (there are security issues
   at stake), then email and we can put one together for you.

4) You do *NOT* need to enable this plugin using conf.pl, since
   it has no functionality in and of itself.  However, if you
   use the Plugin Updates plugin, you do need to enable this 
   plugin in order to see it on the Plugin Updates page:

   ---------- optional ----------

   Go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose option
   8 and add the compatibility plugin.  Save and exit.

      $ cd ../../config
      $ ./conf.pl

   ---------- optional ----------

5) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:
