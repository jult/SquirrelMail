Installing The Compose Extras Plugin
====================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 0.6 version of the Compose
   Extras plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf compose_extras-0.6-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) If you do not want to change the default behavior of this
   plugin, skip to step four.

3) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you want to store the plugin
   configuration file in the plugin directory or in
   the main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the compose_extras directory, copy
      config_example.php to config.php and edit config.php,
      making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd compose_extras
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php
     ----- optional -----

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the compose_extras directory,
      copy config_example.php to ../../config/config_compose_extras.php
      and edit ../../config/config_compose_extras.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd compose_extras
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_compose_extras.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_compose_extras.php
     ----- optional -----

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

5) Also, please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

6) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading Compose Extras
========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 0.6 version of the Compose
   Extras plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf compose_extras-0.6-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the compose_extras directory and check your
   config.php file against the new version to see if
   there are any new settings that you must add to your
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_compose_extras.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step three
   under the installation procedure above).
