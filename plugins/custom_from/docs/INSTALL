Installing The Custom From Plugin
=================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Custom From
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf custom_from-2.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) If you do not want to change the default behavior of this
   plugin, skip to step four.

3) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you want to store the plugin
   configuration file in the plugin directory or in the
   main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the custom_from/config directory and copy the
      example configuration file to config.php and edit
      config.php, making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd custom_from/config
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php
     ----- optional -----

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the custom_from/config
      directory and copy the example configuration file to
      ../../../config/config_custom_from.php and edit
      ../../../config/config_custom_from.php, making adjustments
      as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd custom_from/config
     $ cp config_example_sql.php ../../../config/config_custom_from.php
     $ vi ../../../config/config_custom_from.php
     ----- optional -----


   Next, if you will be restricting access to this plugin to
   certain users, you'll need to copy the example user access
   table and add your own user list to it.  Make sure the path
   to this file in $restrict_access_to_users_file in the main
   configuration file is accurate.  For example:

     ----- optional -----
     $ cp custom_from_access_table_example.php custom_from_access_table.php
     $ vi custom_from_access_table.php
     ----- optional -----

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

5) If you are not running SquirrelMail version 1.4.12 or above,
   please verify that you have the Compatibility plugin (version
   2.0.15 or above) installed.

6) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading The Custom From Plugin
================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Custom From
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf custom_from-2.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the custom_from/config directory and check
   your config.php file against the new version to see if
   there are any new settings that you must add to your
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../../config/config_custom_from.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step three
   under the installation procedure above).
