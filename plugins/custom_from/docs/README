Custom From plugin for SquirrelMail
===================================
Ver 2.0, 2012/03/01


Copyright (c) 2003-2012 Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>



Description
===========

This plugin adds a "From:" text field to the compose screen.
This allows the user to specify an arbitrary From address (that
will also be used as the "Reply-To").  If this "From:" field is
left blank, the normal identity selector (just above it) is used.

The administrator may provide a list of users who are allowed to
use this feature, perhaps making this a super-user or administrative
tool.



Donations
=========

If you or your company make regular use of this software,
please consider supporting Open Source development by
donating to the authors or inquire about hiring them to
consult on other projects.  Donation/wish list links for

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.0 or above

  * Compatibility plugin version 2.0.15+ unless using SquirrelMail 1.4.12+



License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file COPYING for details).



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Custom From
    configuration files, one in the custom_from/config directory
    and one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_custom_from.php").  The one in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory will always override the one in the
    custom_from/config directory.

    be ignored.

  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.
