Installing Plugin
=================
Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is
in its own directory, and that the name of the directory is the name
of the plugin. For example:

  $ cd /var/www/squirrelmail/plugins
  $ tar -zxvf /home/archives/folder_settings-0.3-1.4.0.tar.gz

Then go to SquirrelMail config directory and run conf.pl. Choose option
8 and enable the plugin.

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

Save configuration changes and exit.

Plugin translations use folder_settings domain. folder_settings.po and 
folder_settings.mo files should be stored in same directory that stores 
squirrelmail.po and squirrelmail.mo files. Translations are maintained 
by SquirrelMail Internationalization Team and are distributed in 
SquirrelMail locale packages.
