Folder Settings plugin

Description
===========
I hope to develop this plugin to allow for a whole range of folder-
specific settings.  At the moment it just does one thing...
Alters folder sorting behavior so that individual folders remember
their message-sort settings.

Requirements
============
This plugin version requires SquirrelMail 1.4.x. Plugin functions are 
included in SquirrelMail 1.5.1 and newer.

Usage
=====
There are two new options on the 'Folder Preferences' page:

Enable per-folder sorting
-------------------------
If this is enabled, changing the sort order of a folder will change
the behavior of that folder only.  Other folders will continue to
use the default sort order (see below) or their own, individual setting.

Default Sort Order
-------------------
This is where you specify the default sort order, for all folders which
don't have their own setting.  If you don't specify anything here, the
default will be Date (descending).

Note: changing a folder's sort order back to the default clears the
setting for that folder and it will revert to following the default
setting.

To Do
=====

1. Allow sort settings for the Inbox, Sent and Trash folders to be
   specified on the options page.
2. Think of a good way for the user to explicitly reset a folder to the
   default (as in a big button with Reset on it).
