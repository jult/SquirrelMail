Description
===========

This plugin automatically synchronizes the folder list and
the message list.  This can be used, when the folder list
is configured to automatically refresh itself (SquirrelMail
does this by default), to ensure that the message list always
shows newest incoming messages.

The administrator can set defaults for whether refreshes
containing new message totals in the folder list should trigger
a refresh of the message list screen and whether, conversely,
actions in the message list screen or viewing of a message that
change the number of (un)read messages should trigger a refresh
of the folder list screen.  The administrator can choose if
users should also be able to override the default settings.

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.0 or above
  * JavaScript support in end-user browsers



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Folder Synchronization
    configuration files, one in the folder_synch directory and
    one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_folder_synch.php").  The one in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory will always override the one in the
    folder_synch directory.

TODO
====

  * Some plumbing is in place for compatibility with SquirrelMail
    version 1.5.2+; need to finish it



Change Log
==========

  v1.0  2011/04/21  Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>
    * Complete cleanup, update and re-write
    * Synchronization now includes total message count
      (instead of only unread message count)
    * Message list checkboxes now preserved across message
      list refreshes (SquirrelMail 1.4.13+)
    * Options now moved to "Folder Preferences" options page
    * Options are now properly localized
    * Added a configuration file where the administrator has
      the abiltiy to control default user settings and can
      control whether or not users can change the defaults for
      themselves
    * Allow configuration file to be stored in main SquirrelMail
      configuration directory if desired

  v0.8  2003/06/17  Nick Bartos
    * Changed option names in pref file back to old values.
      Now right side should not be refreshed when reading a
      message. Also a few javascript fixes to prevent errors
      from happening
    * Fast loading SquirrelMail compatible, versioning compatible
    * This should now work with SquirrelMail 1.4
    * Also unneeded refreshes should be reduced, you should now
      only get a refresh when the number of new messages in the
      folder you are viewing change.

  v0.6  2002/12/04  Jimmy Conner <jimmy@advcs.org>
    * Fixed the JavaScript routines to count the number of
      messages (even when there are over 9 in a folder)
    * Now counts the messages whether in Seen/Unseen mode or
      just Seen mode
    * Disables JavaScript if not displaying number of messages
    * Fixes for the JavaScript errors that it threw up
    * Removed old debug code that logged errors to the apache logs
    * Removed a little unneccesary code 

  v0.5  2002/01/15  Jay Guerette <JayGuerette@pobox.com>
    * If you are using IE 5+, NS 6+, or some other Mozilla 4+ Gecko-
      based browser, an enhanced new-mail detection routine will kick
      in, to almost eliminate unnecessary screen refreshes of the
      message list display.  It will typically only refresh the message
      list when the unread mail counts in the folder list change.
    * This version has many code tweaks and optimizations from user feedback
