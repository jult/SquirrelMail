Identity Folders plugin for SquirrelMail
========================================
Version 1.0, 2014/01/20


Copyright (c) 2013-2014 Paul Lesniewski <paul@squirrelmail.org>



Description
===========

This plugin allows users to specify a folder that will
serve as the default sent message location when replying
to messages sent to any of the identities configured on
the advanced identities screen.  Keep in mind that this
plugin only sets the default folder selection for the
custom sent folder drop-down list (which is provided by
the Variable Sent Folder plugin), and only does so when
replying to messages that were sent to a pre-configured
identity.  The Per Recipient Sent Folders plugin may
be more useful depending on your needs.

Before looking for help elsewhere, please try to help yourself:
  
  * Look to see if others have already asked about the same issue.
    There are tips and links for the best places to do this in
    the SquirrelMail mailing list posting guidelines:
    http://squirrelmail.org/wiki/MailingListPostingGuidelines
    You should also try Google or some other search engine.
  
  * If you cannot find any information about your issue, please
    first mail your help request to the squirrelmail-plugins
    mailing list.  Information about it can be found here:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/squirrelmail-plugins
    You MUST read the mailing list posting guidelines (see above)
    and include as much information about your issue (and your
    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug
    output, the plugin configuration settings you've made and
    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.
  
  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.



TODO
====

  * Currently, it's assumed the mail folder input is only used for
    the Variable Sent Folder hook (custom sent folder default), but
    in the future, if it's used for something else, we should have
    a user option (checkbox?) to enable the ability to use this folder
    as the default sent folder (either put that option right next to
    the folder select on the idents page or on the display prefs or
    folder prefs page)... when we make such a change, remove the text
    from the idents page folder select "(default folder for sent messages)"
