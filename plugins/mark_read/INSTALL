Installing The Mark Read Plugin
===============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Mark Read
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf mark_read-2.0-1.2.tar.gz

2) If you do not want to change the default behavior of this
   plugin, skip to step four.

3) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you want to store the plugin
   configuration file in the plugin directory or in
   the main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the mark_read directory, copy
      config_example.php to config.php and edit config.php,
      making adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd mark_read
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php
     ----- optional -----

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the mark_read directory,
      copy config_example.php to ../../config/config_mark_read.php
      and edit ../../config/config_mark_read.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd mark_read
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_mark_read.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_mark_read.php
     ----- optional -----

4) If you are using SquirrelMail 1.4.1 or above (except 1.5.0),
   skip to step 6.

5) If you are using SquirrelMail 1.2.x, 1.4.0 or 1.5.0 (you
   really should upgrade!), download the Empty Folders plugin
   and update your source code for use with this plugin.  Details
   about how to do so can be found in the Empty Folders INSTALL
   file.  You do NOT need to keep the Empty Folders plugin after
   you have updated your SquirrelMail source code.

6) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

7) Verify that you have the Compatibility plugin installed.

8) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading Mark Read
===================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Mark Read
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf mark_read-2.0-1.2.tar.gz

2) Change into the mark_read directory and check your
   config.php file against the new version to see if
   there are any new settings that you must add to your
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_mark_read.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step three
   under the installation procedure above).

3) You never need to patch SquirrelMail again if you've done it
   once before (or unless the release notes/changelog say otherwise).
