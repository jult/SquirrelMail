Description
===========

This plugin places "read" and/or "unread" links next to any of
the folders in the folder list, or "Read All" and/or "Unread All"
buttons on the mailbox listing page.  These buttons or links will
mark all messages in the associated folder as having been read
or unread.

If enabled by the administrator, users can control the
appearance and behavior of these links and buttons by
navigating to the "Folders" page in the SquirrelMail
interface.



RPC Interface
=============

This plugin can be used via the SquirrelMail RPC interface (as of
SquirrelMail 1.5.2+).  It handles the following commands:

  mark_read_read_all   - marks all messages in the given folder
                         (specified by the "mailbox" argument in
                         the RPC request) as read
  mark_read_unread_all - marks all messages in the given folder
                         (specified by the "mailbox" argument in
                         the RPC request) as unread
   
Error codes that may be returned:

  503 - mark_read_read_all failed
  504 - mark_read_unread_all failed

Requirements
============

 * SquirrelMail 1.2 or above

 * Compatibility plugin version 2.0.12 or above



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If a (un)read link is not showing next to some of the folders
    for which it is configured, make sure those folders have one
    or more messages in them (otherwise, the link will not be
    displayed).

  * If a (un)read link is not showing next to the trash folder
    make sure you are running SquirrelMail version 1.4.16 or above;
    previous versions do not allow appending links after the trash
    folder.

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be showing
    in the user interface, first check that you have not overridden
    the configuration settings with user preference settings that
    are shown on the Folders page.  Otherwise, ensure that you are
    editing the correct configuration file.  If one is located in
    the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_mark_read.php"), it will always be used.  Otherwise,
    "config.php" in the mark_read plugin directory will be used.

    You MUST read the mailing list posting guidelines (see above)
    and include as much information about your issue (and your
    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug

    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.

  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.



TODO

  * Re-add features in version 1.4.2 that were removed in version
    2.0, but only if someone can justify that they are actually
    necessary
