License

Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be showing
    in the user interface, ensure that you are editing the correct
    configuration file.  If one is located in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory (named "config_multiple_attachments.php"), it will
    always be used.  Otherwise, "config.php" in the multiple_attachments
    plugin directory will be used.
