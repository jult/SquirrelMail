The Notify plugin provides a minimal browser window that will notify the user
when they have new mail.

On installation a link "Show Notify Popup" will be placed below the folder
list. Clicking this link opens a small window showing whether the user has new
mail waiting.

Additional options on the Display Options page control:

* how often new mail is checked - the default is five minutes, and the value
  can be between one and thirty minutes

* whether to play a sound when there is unread mail

This plugin requires Javascript - this is used to restore the popup window if
it is minimised, and for refreshing the popup window.

The sound is stored in notify.wav - change this file if you want to use a
different sound.

Notify is maintained by Richard Gee - if you like it, have any comments, or
find any bugs, please email me at richard.gee@pseudocode.co.uk
