1.0.0 

Initial version.  Almost perfect :-).

2.0.0 

BUG:  Correct coding blunder which bypassed the logon pruning
for users without a recurring prune interval.

Minor admin cleanups.

3.0.0 

BUG: Eliminate use of bin2hex since there's no official hex2bin

Include proon version on the link text at the bottom of the
proon settings form

Reimplement proon_version() to dynamically read the version file

4.0.0 

Czech (cs_CZ) translation by Daniel Kahoun.  Also, various
locale-related fix-ups in the proon code based on suggestions
from him and several others on SM mailing lists.

BUG: I18N-ize display of "INBOX" on the proon options form and in
autopruning reports.

BUG: Better checking within the 'webmail_top' hook function in a hope
to cure some login problems being reported.  If you were having
errors about user preferences or default_pref at login time, this
probably fixes it for you.

Guard calls to sqGetGlobalVariable with sqsession_is_registered.
I don't know if it's needed, but I guess it doesn't hurt.

BUG: Fix a glitch in disabled date/size/count.  UI was showing things
properly, but those factors weren't actually being ignored.  Oops.

BUG: Someone reported seeing empty spaces where they should have been
seeing numbers in the pruning summaries.  Most likely they were 
zeroes being misrepresented by magical PHP type guessing.

Proon now looks for translations under the main SM locale directory
instead of under the proon/locale directory.  Translations can be
done independent of the proon release cycle now.  (Thanks to Fredrik
Jervfors (and others) for making this suggestion in a way that my
dense brain finally understood it.)

The occasional server is careless about reporting the READ-WRITE
status of folders.  Proon's check for that is a lot fancier now to
account for that.

5.0.0

Sitewide preferences corresponding to user preferences.  For example,
Trash pruned to a certain size every couple of days.  Users can do
more restrictive things, but the site admin sets the floor.
(site-config item "$proon_site_min_interval" is obsolete.)

New user option for how frequently to do login pruning if they don't
want it every login.  Can be, for example, every 3rd login.  This,
combined with site settings for the Trash folder, allows you to
accomplish the essence of what the empty_trash plugin does.

Allow specific folders to be exempted from automatic pruning.  They
can still have pruning preferences set, but it takes a manual click
of the "Proon now" button to make it happen.  (Suggested by Michael D. 
Shook.)

Allow configuration option for using squirrel_logger instead of
homebrew logging stuff.  See notes site-config.php.sample.

Folder Table now includes subscribed folders, unsubscribed folders,
and non-existent folders.  For unsubscribed and non-existent folders,
they're only listed if there is at least one user preference or site
preference item for them.  The idea is to avoid surprising someone
who starts using a folder that has one of those names.

proon/locale/proon.pot updated due to several UI string additions
and tweaks.  Matching updated cs_CZ translation.

BUG: Fixed a bug which sometimes forced an attempt to prune the Trash
folder even if no values were given for any spans.  The pruning
attempt was a no-op, but it resulted in a bogus complaint that there
were no span settings for the Trash folder.

BUG: Login-time and automatic pruning were skipping folders which only
had values for the count span.  Fixed.

6.0.0

No locale string changes in this release.  If site preferences for
pruning are important to you, you probably want to take this upgrade.

BUG: Site preferences for folder spans were being ignored if there
was no user-specified span on a given folder.  This effectively masked
the site preferences feature completely for vast tracts of users.  Drat!

BUG: User preference for unsubscribed folders would defeat site
preference-based pruning of those same folders.

BUG: If an unsubscribed folder had no user-specified spans but did
have site-preference spans, those folders showed up in the non-existent
folders part of the table instead of the unsubscribed folders part.

7.0.0

BUG: Due to a change in the SM core in 1.4.6 (related to security
vulnerability CVE-2006-0188), the onetime setup stuff has been giving
an error since then.  I finally got around to tracking this down and
recoding it.  As a side-effect, proon now has its own Options subpage
instead of being just a link of the Folders subpage.  The hooks used
by proon are also tweaked a bit for this change.

BUG: Quoted the constant names in define() statements for better PHP
compliance.  Pointed out by ajos1@

7.0.1

BUG: Missing $ on a variable name in hook.php.

8.0.0

BUG: Some sites couldn't find proon/form.php under some circumstances.
It never happened for me locally, so I couldn't pin it down.  Tim Rice
sent me a patch that cures it for him, and it does no harm here.

MYSTERY:  There is a bug reported by a few people, but which I have
been unable to reproduce locally.  They can manually prune folders,
but the automatic pruning (either at login time or at the recurring
time period) doesn't seem to ever happen.  If you see this problem and
can work with me to figure it out, please get in touch.
