"This page allows you to conveniently prune messages from any or all folders "
"by using a variety of criteria.  Messages can be pruned manually from this "
"page, or they can be pruned automatically at sign-on and every so often.  "
"Before using the automatic pruning, it would be a good idea to test your "
"settings manually from this page to be sure they do what you want them to "
"do.  Automatic pruning is enabled by giving an appropriate value for the "
"'Recurring Prune Interval' option, though sign-on pruning is done even if "
"you don't give a value for that."

"Your local SquirrelMail administrator may have specified site settings for "
"one or more options or per-folders items.  In such a case where there is a "
"site setting, it supersedes the user setting (except as noted for particular "
"items below).  Since the site settings are administered separately, your "
"user settings are shown and can be edited even if site settings supersede "
"them.  The site settings, if any, are shown immediately below the "
"corresponding user setting in the User Preferences table and the Folder "
"Table."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is an explanation for the user preferences and per-folder data which "
"control selective automatic pruning of folders.  Pruning means the deletion "
"of messages either because they are older than a certain date or to bring a "
"folder to within a certain total size limit or number of messages."
"<ul><li>Pruning first considers message dates (if there is a user-specified "
"date span value for that folder).  A message's date is the time since it was "
"received by the mail server (this so-called 'internal date' is preserved if "
"you move a message between folders).  Messages are deleted if they have an "
"internal date older than the age indicated by the date span value.</"
"li><li>Pruning next considers total folder size (if there is a user-"
"specified folder size span).  If the folder is over that size limit, "
"additional messages are pruned until the folder is at or below it.</"
"li><li>Pruning finally considers the number of messages in the folder (if "
"there is a user-specified count span).  If a folder has more than that many "
"messages, additional messages are pruned until the folder is at or below the "
"limit.</li></ul><p>In all those pruning cases, unread messages are normally "
"protected and not pruned.  That protection can be removed on a folder-by-"
"folder basis.  Pruning behavior may be flexibly controlled using a variety "
"of other user preferences, each of which is described more fully below.  "
"Unsubscribed and non-existent folders are listed if there is any user "
"preference or site preference given for that folder; this is to avoid a "
"surprise if you suddenly start using a folder of some name and would not "
"otherwise realize that it had pruning options."
msgstr ""

msgid "Here are some examples of fairly typical settings."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Set a recurring pruning interval of 24 hours, just in case you stay logged "
"on for a long time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the 'Sent' folder, prune messages older than a week, including unseen "
"messages.  This assumes you don't use your 'Sent' folder as a general "
"collecting area.  If you haven't needed to retrieve something from there in "
"a week (because you forgot to save a copy elsewhere), it can be tossed out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the 'Trash' folder, prune messages older than 3 days.  Prune the 'Trash' "
"folder to no more than 500 kilobytes or 20 total messages.  Include unseen "
"messages in the pruning."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For the 'Drafts' folder, prune anything older than 6 months on the grounds "
"that if you haven't gotten around to finishing a note in that amount of "
"time, you're never going to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a 'might be spam' quarantine folder, prune messages older than 30 days, "
"and prune the folder to no more than 2 megabytes.  Again, do not protect "
"unseen messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For a high-traffic mailing list folder, which you only skim from time to "
"time, prune messages older than a week, including unseen messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A date span is a relative time duration and is specified as a combination of "
"days and hours.  The overall time duration may not be negative.  For safety, "
"a value of 0 is treated the same as no value being specified.  A simple "
"number is interpreted as a number of days.  If there is a slash ('<code>/</"
"code>'), the number after the slash is interpreted as a number of hours. If "
"days and hours are both specified, they are simply added together.  Some "
"examples are shown in the table below."
msgstr ""

msgid "6 days"
msgstr ""

msgid "6 days plus 2 hours"
msgstr ""

msgid "2 hours"

msgstr ""

msgid "Same as blank"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If there is both a site setting and a user setting for a given folder, the "
"minimum of the two values is used."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A size span counts total bytes in a folder.  The size may not be negative.  "
"For safety, a value of 0 is treated the same as no value being specified.  A "
"size consists of a number and an optional suffix character.  The suffix "
"character indicates a multiplier, as shown in the table below.  A number "
"without a suffix gets a default suffix of 'm'."

"A count span counts messages in a folder.  The count may not be negative.  "
"For safety, a value of 0 is treated the same as no value being specified.  "
"Unlike a date span or a size span, a count span is always just a simple "
"numeric value with no additional type of notation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this item is selected for a given folder, unseen (i.e., unread) messages "
"have no special protection against pruning.  If not selected (the default), "
"then the pruning process will not prune any unseen messages in the "
"corresponding folder.  You might consider allowed unseen messages to be "
"pruned from spam quanantine folders and folders which receive mailing list "
"traffic which you don't always read.  You should be especially careful of "
"the date, size, and count spans you specify for folders with this box "
"checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this item is selected for a given folder, the folder will not be "
"automatically pruned.  It will only be pruned through manual action by you.  "
"Manual action means selecting either 'Prune All Folders' or 'Prune Now' from "
"the pruning options form.  Automatic pruning means sign-on pruning as well "
"as periodic pruning (if that option is selected)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This action button simulates pruning of the associated folder.  The number "
"of messages which would have been pruned is displayed.  If there is not at "
"least one span value specified for the folder, an error message is shown."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This action button immediately prunes the associated folder.  The number of "
"messages which were pruned is displayed.  If there is not at least one span "
"value specified for the folder, an error message is shown and no messages "
"are pruned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This action button is similar to the 'Show Effect' action button, except "
"that the entire list of folders (and their individual settings) is used.  "
"Folders without at least one span value specified are silently skipped.  The "
"numbers reported for the Trash folder do not take into account any messages "
"that might be sent to the Trash folder as a result of pruning other folders."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In effect, this action is the same as automatic pruning, except that it's "
"triggered manually (and email reports are not made).  This action button is "
"similar to the 'Prune Now' action button, except that the entire list of "
"folders (and their invididual settings) is used.  Folders without at least "
"one span value specified are silently skipped.  If some folders have "
"erroneous values, an error message is shown for them, but other (non-error) "
"folders are still pruned."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This action button saves all user preference values and per-folder "
"settings.  If there are errors detected in the user options or per-folder "
"settings, the save is not done.  As an aid to the user, the button has a "
"different appearance when there are known differences between the values on "
"this page and the values that have already been saved in the past.  That "
"really only applies when the page has been redrawn after one of the action "
"buttons.  The button appearance is not dynamically updated as you edit "
"values on the page."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The following table describes user preferences that can affect how pruning "
"is done or not done for you in particular.  The behavior might be changed or "
"limited by site settings controlled by your local administrator.  "
"Descriptions here are in the same order as the User Preferences form above."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ordinarily, there is one pruning attempt at SquirrelMail sign-on time.  If "
"you want the sign-on prunings to be done less often, you can specify a "
"number here.  For example, a value of 3 means 'every 3rd sign-on'.  No value "
"specified or a value of 0 means 'every sign-on'.  The local SquirrelMail "
"site administrator may have specified a maximum value for sign-on pruning "
"frequency, in which case that takes precedence if it is lower."
msgstr ""

msgid "maximum"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Pruning can be done manually from this options page, or it can be done "
"periodically and automatically.  This item specifies the recurring time "
"period.  The format is the same as for the date span values for individual "
"folders.  If not specified, no automatic/periodic pruning will be done; so, "
"you can think of this field as an on/off switch for automatic pruning.  For "
"safety, a value of 0 is treated the same as no value specified.  The local "
"SquirrelMail site administrator may have specified a minimum pruning "
"interval, in which case that takes precedence if it is lower.  The recurring "
"interval is measured from the SquirrelMail session sign-on, so automatic "
"pruning attempts will be made at the specified intervals thereafter.  The "
"actual pruning happens coincident with some screen update activity, so an "
"idle SquirrelMail session will not be doing any automatic pruning."
msgstr ""

msgid "minimum"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this box is checked, messages pruned from other folders will be sent to "
"the Trash folder.  Messages pruned from the Trash folder will be discarded.  "
"If this box is not checked, messages pruned from all folders will be "
"discarded immediately.  This setting is independent of the overall "
"SquirrelMail setting for using the Trash folder when deleting messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If any pruning is requested for the Trash folder along with other folders, "
"this preference controls the ordering.  'First' means that the Trash folder "
"is pruned first, so at the end of a pruning session, it will hold the "
"messages pruned from other folders.  'Last' means that the Trash folder is "
"pruned last, so any messages moved there via pruning will then be subject to "
"a second pruning at the end.  'Natural' means that the Trash folder will be "
"pruned according to its natural order in the list of folders; in other "
"words, it gets no special treatment with respect to ordering.  If no choice "
"is made, the default is 'First'.  This setting makes no practical difference "
"unless 'Prune via Trash' is selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this box is checked, pruning may also consider unsubscribed folders.  If "
"not checked, only subscribed folders are considered, whether for manual "
"pruning or automatic pruning (you can still use the per-folder 'Show Effect' "
"or 'Prune Now' buttons).  This may be handy if you have unsubscribed folders "
"which receive messages in some way other than by manually refiling things to "
"them.  You can only add settings for a folder by subscribing to it, at least "
"temporarily, but settings for unsubscribed folders are used if this box is "
"checked."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this disable box is checked, pruning by message date will not be done.  "
"Any per-folder values for the date span column will still be displayed, but "
"they cannot be updated."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this disable box is checked, pruning by message size will not be done.  "
"Any per-folder values for the size span column will still be displayed, but "

"If disable this box is checked, pruning by message count will not be done.  "
"Any per-folder values for the count span column will still be displayed, but "

msgid ""
"When considering which messages to prune by size span and/or by count span, "
"there are two possible orders in which to consider them.  They can be "
"considered by date, in which case messages are pruned from oldest to newest "
"until the size or message count limit for the folder is met.  Or, they can "
"be considered by size, in which case messages are pruned from largest to "
"smallest until the size or message count limit is met.  If neither is "
"selected, the default order is by date."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this box is checked, a report summarizing automatic pruning will be put "
"into the INBOX as a new message.  An email report is not made if no messages "
"were pruned and no errors occurred."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this box is checked, a report summarizing automatic pruning will be made "
"part of the message-list panel.  In contrast to the email notification, a "

"This options page is normally constructed using colors from the user-chosen "
"SquirrelMail theme, both to make a pleasing display and to highlight "
