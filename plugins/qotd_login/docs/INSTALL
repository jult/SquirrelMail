Installing The Quote of the Day at Login Plugin
===============================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Quote of the
   Day at Login plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf qotd_login-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) If you do not want to change the default behavior of this
   plugin, skip to step four.

3) (OPTIONAL) Decide if you want to store the plugin
   configuration file in the plugin directory or in the
   main SquirrelMail config directory.

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the qotd_login directory and copy the example
      configuration file to config.php and edit config.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd qotd_login
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php
     ----- optional -----

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the qotd_login directory
      and copy the example configuration file to
      ../../config/config_qotd_login.php and edit
      ../../config/config_qotd_login.php, making adjustments
      as you deem necessary.

     ----- optional -----
     $ cd qotd_login
     $ cp config_example_sql.php ../../config/config_qotd_login.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_qotd_login.php
     ----- optional -----

4) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl



Upgrading The Quote of the Day at Login Plugin
==============================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Quote of the
   Day at Login plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf qotd_login-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the qotd_login directory and check your
   config.php file against the new version to see if
   there are any new settings that you must add to your
   config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_qotd_login.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your configuration file with the provided
   example and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step three
   under the installation procedure above).
