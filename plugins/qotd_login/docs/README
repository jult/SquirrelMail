Description
===========

This plugin displays a random "quote of the day" on the login page
beneath the username/password fields.



License

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file COPYING for details).

Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.0 or above



Troubleshooting
===============

  * Make sure the plugin is configured correctly by browsing to
    http://your-squirrelmail-location/src/configtest.php

  * If you are having problems retrieving quotes from qotd.org,
    turn on $qotd_login_debug in the configuration file

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Quote of the Day
    at Login configuration files, one in the qotd_login directory
    and one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_qotd_login.php").  The one in the main SquirrelMail
    config directory will always override the one in the qotd_login
    directory.
