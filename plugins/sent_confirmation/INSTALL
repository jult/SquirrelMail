Installing Sent Confirmation
============================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the sent_confirmation 
plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf sent_confirmation-1.0-1.2.tar.gz

2) Change into the sent_confirmation directory, copy config.php.sample
   to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
   you deem necessary.  

  $ cd sent_confirmation
  $ cp config.php.sample config.php
  $ vi config.php

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Also, please verify that you have the "compatibility" plugin
   installed.



Upgrading Sent Confirmation
===========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the sent_confirmation plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf sent_confirmation-1.0-1.2.tar.gz


2) Change into the sent_confirmation directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).

   * As of version 1.6, there is an extra entry in the user preferences
     that might disable the confirmation message for users who had
     had it turned on under version 1.5.

     To avoid this happening, you can either set the default style
     in config.php to anything other than 'off', or you can make
     sure that all users view their preferences screen once after 
     version 1.6 is installed, verify their new settings, and click
     "Submit".  The best solution is to simply add the new preference 
     entry to any preference files that need it: 

    $ echo 'sent_conf_enable=1' | tee -a `grep -rEin 'sent_conf_style=[1234]' /path/to/squirrelmail/data/directory/ | sed 's/:.*//'`
