Sent Confirmation plugin for SquirrelMail
=========================================
Ver 1.6, 29/02/04

Original author: Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>

Thanks to:

   Dustin Anders, Andy Brook <andyb@iserv.net> 
   and Christian Sauer <christian@endrun.org> for their
   address_book_import_export plugin, from which the address
   book import code was stolen and modified for use here.

   Wolf Bergenheim <wolf@bergenheim.net> for ideas and some 
   code borrowed from his To-Do Reminder plugin.


Description
===========

This plugin displays a confirmation message above the
message index after a message is successfully sent.
It can also display a screen offering the option to
add any of the message's recipients to the user's address
book or move, delete or return to the original message 
in the case of replies and forwards.

In combination with the "Restrict Senders" plugin, it
also displays any addresses on the outgoing mail that
were blocked.


Warning: SquirrelMail 1.4.1
===========================

It has been reported that deleting the original message 
in a nested folder may delete ALL messages in the folder
when using this plugin with SquirrelMail 1.4.1.  Although
this has only been reported once and has not been reproducable
by the author of this plugin, this is a serious enough
problem that it is advisable to upgrade to the latest 
stable release of SquirrelMail.


Known Bugs
===========

When SMTP/sendmail errors occur upon sending, the next time this 
plugin has the chance to run, it displays the sent confirmation, 
even though the message DID NOT get sent due to the SMTP/sendmail
errors.  This is an architectural compromise.  It could be solved 
by adding a new hook just after the message was sent in the SM 
core, but for now, I'll assume that most SM installations actually 
have working SMTP or sendmail servers.


Change Log
==========

  1.6 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * New options descriptions - make much more 
     sense - thanks to Kurt Yoder <freespirit74@yahoo.com>
   * Many changes for full compatibility with new
     "Preview Pane" plugin
   * Full internationalization - send your translations!
   * Minor fix; some PHP installations were showing 
     a zero at bottom of the confirmation screen.
   * Minor code refactoring

  1.5 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Removed PHP notice/warnings that appeared on 
     compose screen when replying.

  1.4 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Fixed double page headers with styles one and
     two 
   * Page header now shows current mailbox for styles 
     three and four
   * Changed "Compose" links to "Close" links for 
     styles three and four when using "compose in 
     new window" functionality
   * Fixed bad hyperlink URI for address book after
     adding addresses
  
  1.3 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Fixed poor address parsing - sorry!  It now
     correctly pulls apart addresses in the form 
     "Name" <addr@domain.com>
   * Smarter parsing of nicknames (in the case of
     addresses as above, anything in quotes is used
     as the nickname).  It also attempts to pull out
     first and last name from the nickname

  1.2 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Added same controls for forwarded messages as we
     already have for replies
   * When user sent a reply to a message not on page
     one of message list, the correct page is returned
     to after confirmation
   * Saved Drafs no longer interpreted as sent messages
   * Resumed and sent drafts ARE interpreted as sent
     messages
   * Removed need for patching SquirrelMail source
     for compose in new window functionality
   * Added ability to display addresses blocked by the
     "Restrict Senders" plugin.
   * Themes should always display correctly 
   * Don't get reply info if we won't be using
     it (styles 1 and 2) (because it costs an actual
     extra imap login)
   * Fixed conflict with Quicksave plugin where Quicksave
     would give false alerts if Sent Confirmation modes
     3 or 4 were used to not return to the message list

  1.1 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Added ability to move, delete or return to the 
     original message from confirmation screen (display 
     modes 3 and 4) after sending a reply.
   * Added source patch to make this plugin work with
     "Compose In New Window" functionality
   * Fixed clash with other plugins such as Link Buttons

  1.0 -  Paul Lesneiwski <pdontthink@angrynerds.com>
   * Initial release



Future Work
===========

   * Disable checkboxes in confirmation screen for addresses
     already in address book.  Problem is that the primary
     key is the nickname; that doesn't stop us for grepping
     the address book for an email address, but for now, this
     is left up to the user...

   *  Ideas?
