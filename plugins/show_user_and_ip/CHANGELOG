  displayed on the left pane, left, center or right.

  the options for showing or hiding the hostname in MOTD,
  changing the welcome message greeting and font size for
  left pane.
- Added an option to show or hide the hostname under the
  folders list.
- Changed the MOTD message string to one which uses sprintf
  to be able to have better translation (Thanks to Fredrik
  Jervfors <sqm_admin@fimbul.net>)
- Changed the file inclusion behavior to avoid incompatibilities
  with certain plugins (Thanks to Pascal Guinet
  <pascal.guinet@inpes.sante.fr> for feedback)

  <kai@katzur.org>)

  <mukka@pozor.hu>)

- Updated Turkish (tr_TR) translation.

Jan 26, 2005 - version 3.0
- Modified the plugin to be compatible with SquirrelMail 1.4.4
- Incorporated the welcome message into the MOTD.
- The welcome message also shows the last hostname now, if the user
  logged in from a reverse resolvable IP address.
- Split the options in the SquirrelMail Display Options page
  into two seperate options so that user can choose to show
  his/her username or IP address or both under the folders in the
  left pane.
- Translations for version 2.x of the plugin will not be compatible
  with this version, so I have removed the translations.
- Added Turkish (tr_TR) translation for the 3.x branch.

Nov 17, 2003 - version 2.2.3
- Fixed the problem with relative paths. Thanks to Tomas Kuliavas for pointing
  out this problem.
- Added Swedish (sv_SE) translations by Per Eric Rosen (Jan 23, 2004)

Nov 10, 2003 - version 2.2.2
- Removed the month and day strings from the po file as SquirrelMail
  has them since 1.3.x release.
- Added SM's index.php to document root of the plugin for redirection.
- Modified the plugin to comply with SquirrelMail Plugin Standards.
- This is the day our great leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk passed away in 1938.
  We remember his presence with all our respect...

Nov 14, 2002 - version 2.2.1
- The HTML codes were changed to be compatible with HTML 4.0. No
  changes in the display.

Nov 13, 2002 - version 2.2
- The date string can be localised by the SquirrelMail's
  squirrelmail.po date strings.

Nov 11, 2002 - version 2.1.1
- Changed the code because the date function was not showing the
  actual date, but it was showing the number of days in current
  month!

Nov 08, 2002 - version 2.1
- Quite fast, we got 2.1 :-)
- Removed the forgotten 2 test variables (sometimes people can
  get tired :-)
- Added an option under Display Preferences to show and hide
  the username and ip display on left.
- Thanks to Tomas Kuliavas for his patient support.

Nov 07, 2002 - version 2.0
- Changed the code nearly completely. As there is a plugin
  named "Username Display" and it did the username show part
  of my plugin, I wrote a new code that will display the
  username, last connection IP and last connection date over 
  the motd only after he/she logs in (for once per session).
- Still shows the username and ip under the folders list.

Nov 01, 2002 - version 1.0
- Initial release
