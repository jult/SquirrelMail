WHAT IS THIS?

This is a very simple plugin that has two functions:

1. Shows the IP and/or username and/or hostname of the logged user under
the folders list if the user sets them from Display Preferences.
2. Shows upon login, the last connection IP, date and if logged in from a
reverse resolvable address, hostname of the user when he/she first
logs in, under the MOTD.
