Installing The Spam Buttons Plugin
==================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Spam Buttons 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf spam_buttons-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Decide if you want to store the plugin configuration file
   in the plugin directory or in the main SquirrelMail config
   directory.  

   A) To store the configuration file in the plugin directory,
      change into the spam_buttons directory, copy config_example.php
      to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
      you deem necessary.

     $ cd spam_buttons
     $ cp config_example.php config.php
     $ vi config.php

   B) To store the configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
      config directory, change into the spam_buttons directory,
      copy config_example.php to ../../config/config_spam_buttons.php
      and edit ../../config/config_spam_buttons.php, making
      adjustments as you deem necessary.

     $ cd spam_buttons
     $ cp config_example.php ../../config/config_spam_buttons.php
     $ vi ../../config/config_spam_buttons.php

3) If you are running SquirrelMail 1.4.11 or above, or if you 
   have already run the patch included with the Reply Buttons 
   or Bounce plugins, skip to step five.

4) Patch SquirrelMail 1.4.x to enable button display on the message
   list page.  The patch should be run from the spam_buttons 
   directory.  Make sure to use the patch that corresponds closest to
   your SquirrelMail version.

  $ patch -p0 < patches/spam_buttons-squirrelmail-1.4.10.diff

   Note for Windows users: you can get native patch functionality
   by installing this very useful package:
   http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

5) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

6) Also, please verify that you have the "Compatibility" plugin
   installed (but not necessarily activated).

7) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

      http://www.squirrelmail.org/download.php



Upgrading Spam Buttons
======================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 1.0 version of the Spam Buttons 
   plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf spam_buttons-1.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the spam_buttons directory and check your config.php
   file against the new version to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.

  $ diff -u config.php config_example.php

   If you store your configuration file in the main SquirrelMail
   config directory, adjust this command as follows:

  $ diff -u ../../config/config_spam_buttons.php config_example.php

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided example
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
