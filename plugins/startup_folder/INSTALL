Installing Startup Folder
=========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Startup 
   Folder plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf startup_folder-2.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) If you want to change the default behavior of the plugin,
   change into the startup_folder directory, copy 
   config.sample.php to config.php and edit config.php,
   making adjustments as you deem necessary.

  ----- optional -----
  $ cd startup_folder
  $ cp config.sample.php config.php
  $ vi config.php
  ----- optional -----

3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl.  Choose
   option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
   category to the "Installed Plugins" category.  Save and exit.

  $ cd ../../config/
  $ ./conf.pl

4) Translations are not included in this package.  To get a
   translation, download the language pack needed from:

Upgrading Startup Folder
========================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
   Here is a example for the 2.0 version of the Startup 
   Folder plugin.

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf startup_folder-2.0-1.4.0.tar.gz

2) Change into the startup_folder directory, check your config.php
   file against the new version, to see if there are any new
   settings that you must add to your config.php file.  (This
   step only applies if you have created a config.php file
   under step 2 above when you first installed the plugin.)

  $ diff -u config.php config.sample.php

   Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
   and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
   installation procedure above).
