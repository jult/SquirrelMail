Description
===========

This plugin allows the user to change the mail folder that is
displayed when first logging in.  It also allows certain plugin
pages to be displayed instead of a mail folder.

A new option is added to the "Folder Preferences" page (which
is found on the "Options" menu) where the "Startup Location" 
can be changed.  If the administrator has added some plugin 
startup locations in the configuration file, the user is also
allowed to choose from a list of "other" (plugin) startup 
locations.  

The administrator may also set the startup location
and disallow users from overriding it, in which case no 
interface options are added to SquirrelMail.
