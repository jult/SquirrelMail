Installation
============

Simply untar the file in the plugins directory, and make sure it is in its own
directory, and that the name of the directory is the name of the plugin. The
example below uses v0.8 of the Unsafe Image Rules plugin:

  $ cd plugins
  $ tar -zxvf unsafe_image_rules.0.8-1.4.tar.gz

Then go to your config directory and run "conf.pl". Choose option 8 and add the
plugin (+). Save and exit, then that should be all if the plugin was made
correctly.

  $ cd ../config
  $ ./conf.pl

Configuration
=============

There is a chance that you, as the administrator may not want to give the users
the "Trust all sources" option. If this is the case, copy "config.php.sample" to
"config.php" and change the following line:

$unsafe_image_rules_disable_all = 0;

to:

$unsafe_image_rules_disable_all = 1;
