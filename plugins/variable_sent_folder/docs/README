Description
===========

This plugin places a drop-down selector on the message
compose screen that allows users to select which folder
to save the sent message into.  When replying, it also
allows the user to move the original message to the same
folder if desired.

The default value for the folder selection drop-down
can be modified by other plugins, such as the Per
Recipient Sent Folders plugin.

License
=======

This plugin is released under the GNU General Public
License (see the file COPYING for details).



Requirements
============

  * SquirrelMail version 1.4.6 or above

  * Compatibility plugin version 2.0.5 or above



Troubleshooting
===============

  * If changes to the configuration file don't seem to be having
    any effect, ensure that there are not two Variable Sent Folder
    configuration files, one in the variable_sent_folder directory
    and one in the main SquirrelMail config directory (named
    "config_variable_sent_folder.php").  The one in the main
    SquirrelMail config directory will always override the one in
    the variable_sent_folder directory.



Help Requests
=============

Before looking for help elsewhere, please try to help yourself:
  
  * Read the Troubleshooting section herein.
  
  * Look to see if others have already asked about the same issue.
    There are tips and links for the best places to do this in
    the SquirrelMail mailing list posting guidelines:

    You should also try Google or some other search engine.
  
  * If you cannot find any information about your issue, please
    first mail your help request to the squirrelmail-plugins
    mailing list.  Information about it can be found here:

    You MUST read the mailing list posting guidelines (see above)
    and include as much information about your issue (and your
    system) as possible.  Including configtest output, any debug
    output, the plugin configuration settings you've made and
    anything else you can think of to make it easier to diagnose
    your problem will get you the most useful responses.  Inquiries
    that do not comply with the posting guidelines are liable to
    be ignored.
  
  * If you don't get any replies on the mailing list, you are
    welcome to send a help request to the authors' personal
    address(es), but please be patient with the mailing list.



Plugin Authors' Usage Guide
===========================

As of version 1.0, this plugin provides a hook that other plugins can
use to specify the default value of the custom sent folder drop-down
widget that appears on the compose screen.  The hook is named
"custom_sent_folder" and plugins using it must specify a properly
formatted IMAP folder name in the global variable named
$variable_sent_folder_custom_sent_folder_default (the hook return
value is not used because in SquirrelMail 1.4.x, it is not shared
between plugins on the same hook).  Please note that you should
consider if other plugins are using this hook whether or not you
may wish to respect their custom folder default value (check it
first!) over yours.  You can refer to the Identity Folders plugin
as an example of how to use this hook.
