Installing the Virtual Keyboard Plugin
======================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 0.8 version of the vkeyboard plugin.

           $ cd plugins
           $ tar -zxvf vkeyboard-0.8.tar.gz

2) Change into the vkeyboard directory, copy config.php.sample
to config.php and edit config.php, making adjustments as
you deem necessary. For more detailed explanations about
each of these parameters, consult the README file.

           $ cd vkeyboard
           $ cp config.php.sample config.php
           $ vi config.php


3) Then go to your config directory and run conf.pl. Choose
option 8 and move the plugin from the "Available Plugins"
category to the "Installed Plugins" category. Save and exit.

           $ cd ../../config/
           $ ./conf.pl


Upgrading the Virtual Keyboard Plugin
=====================================

1) Start with untaring the file into the plugins directory.
Here is a example for the 0.8 version of the vkeyboard plugin.

           $ cd plugins
           $ tar -zxvf vkeyboard-0.8.tar.gz


2) Change into the vkeyboard directory, check your config.php
file against the new version, to see if there are any new
settings that you must add to your config.php file.

           $ diff -Nau config.php config.php.sample

Or simply replace your config.php file with the provided sample
and reconfigure the plugin from scratch (see step 2 under the
installation procedure above).
